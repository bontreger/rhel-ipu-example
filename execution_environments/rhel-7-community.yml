# This is a starting-point of an EE for RHEL 7 to 8 migrations. This is a community-based distribution and doesn't rely on an ansible subscription
# As this depends on a deprecated version of Ansible core, all collections should have their versions specified to an exact version release
# The awx-ee may need to be locked at some point in the future
